Hi,

This folder, Project 7 contains code for this OpenClassrooms project 7.

Peter_Scaife_P7 is a google colab notebook containing all the code from preprocessing to prediction

P7.py is the streamlit front end to the credit rating dashboard

app.py is the flask back end that runs the API

The working dashboard is available on heroku see: https://creditapp1ps10.herokuapp.com/

Thanks Peter.
