Hi,

The folder Project 7 contains code for this OpenClassrooms project 7.

Peter_Scaife_P7 is a google colab notebook containing all the code from preprocessing to prediction

P7.py uses streamlit for the front end of the credit rating dashboard

The working dashboard is available on heroku see: https://c038644.herokuapp.com/

Thanks Peter.
